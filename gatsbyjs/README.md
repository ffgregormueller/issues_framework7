# GatsbyJS and Framework7
Test project for using Framework7 (react) with GatsbyJS (default starter)

### Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
gatsby develop
```
instead of
`npm start`

### Where the errors occur

1. Open the site `http://localhost:8000/` to see Gatsby running just fine
2. Click the link on the page to navigate to `http://localhost:8000/framework7`
    - Here the `Page` Component from _framework7-react_ is used
    - The view will throw an error and not render correctly
